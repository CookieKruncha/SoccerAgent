rem Explorer starts us through a fresh `cmd /c`, so our own name appears in the
rem command line; typing START.cmd at a prompt leaves it out. Requiring no
rem arguments too keeps `cmd /c START.cmd play ...` from stopping for a keypress
rem nobody is there to press.
rem find.exe by full path: a Git or MSYS bin directory on PATH shadows it with
rem the Unix `find`, which rejects these arguments.
