"""Finding, checking and identifying student submissions.

A submissions root holds one folder per team::

    submissions/
      2412345-alice-and-bob/
        team.py      required   all of the team's code, in one file
        team.toml    required   team name and members
        README.md    optional   anything the marker should read
        data/        optional   read-only data files, up to DATA_LIMIT_BYTES

The folder name is the team's slug: it identifies the team in every result row,
replay file name and web page, so it is checked and never derived from anything
a student writes inside a file.

**One file of code, deliberately.** ``team.py`` is imported directly by path,
not as a package, so a second module next to it would not be importable and a
submission that splits itself across files would fail at load time on the
server. Detecting that here — before the tournament — turns a zero into a
fixable error message. It also means two submissions can never collide over a
module name, however many run in the same worker process.

Nothing in this module executes submission code. That happens in
:func:`check_behaviour`, which runs ``soccer validate --json`` in a subprocess
with a timeout, because a submission that hangs on import must not be able to
hang the marker.
